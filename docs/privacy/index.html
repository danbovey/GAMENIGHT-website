            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At GAMENIGHT we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
                <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
                <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
                <li>In our apps, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
            <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please <a href='mailt&#111;&#58;h&#37;65&#108;lo&#64;%67ame&#37;&#54;&#69;&#37;69g&#37;68t&#46;%67g'>contact us</a>.</p>
            <p>GAMENIGHT operates several websites including <a href="https://gamenight.gg">gamenight.gg</a> and <a href="https://app.gamenight.gg">app.gamenight.gg</a>. It is GAMENIGHT’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
            <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
            <p>Like most website operators, GAMENIGHT collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GAMENIGHT’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how GAMENIGHT’s visitors use its website. From time to time, GAMENIGHT may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>GAMENIGHT also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.</li>
            <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>Certain visitors to GAMENIGHT’s websites choose to interact with GAMENIGHT in ways that require GAMENIGHT to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that GAMENIGHT gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide a username or social provider login. GAMENIGHT collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with GAMENIGHT. GAMENIGHT does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
            <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
            GAMENIGHT may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, GAMENIGHT may monitor popular games or user behaviour. GAMENIGHT may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, GAMENIGHT does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
            <h3>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3>
            <p>With your authorization, we may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log in through a social media service (like Google) we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p>
            <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>GAMENIGHT discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on GAMENIGHT’s behalf or to provide services available at GAMENIGHT’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using GAMENIGHT’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. GAMENIGHT will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, GAMENIGHT discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when GAMENIGHT believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of GAMENIGHT, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an GAMENIGHT website and have supplied your email address, GAMENIGHT may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with GAMENIGHT and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. GAMENIGHT takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. GAMENIGHT uses cookies to help GAMENIGHT identify and track visitors, their usage of GAMENIGHT website, and their website access preferences. GAMENIGHT visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using GAMENIGHT’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of GAMENIGHT’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
            <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>If GAMENIGHT, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the event that GAMENIGHT goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of GAMENIGHT may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
            <h3>Ads</h3>
            <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by GAMENIGHT and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
            <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, GAMENIGHT may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in GAMENIGHT’s sole discretion. GAMENIGHT encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a GAMENIGHT account, you should also check the Lobby for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
